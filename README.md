# Charisma-Unicode-Full
Charisma Unicode is a fallback font. Unlike GNU Unifont, all the glyphs are not designed in a pixel style.

Since the font file is too big, you can go to this link to download this font.

After downloading this font, you need to go to the settings to customize your profile (Google Chrome only)

After that, you need to click on [Apperance] -> [Customize fonts] and change the Default, sans-serif and serif font to [Charisma New]. For the monospaced font, you need to download the font [HanaMinA]. For the Math font, you need to download the font [XCharter Math] or my [Charlie Math]. <img width="1136" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-10 at 17 52 59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd47718f-74b2-427d-b743-6bb353840f36" />

However, the worst thing is: there are many missing conjuncts and ligatures for the Indic scripts, such as Bengali, Devanagari, Tamil etc. You can download [Nirmala UI] in Fontke (Mac Only).

The next version (16.2) will be released tomorrow. I have improved many Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics glyphs. There is a defect of the glyph [á˜ ] Canadian Syllabics Jji in the first version, so for the future version, I have fixed it already.

This font is designed my marcotoa in FontForge.

Charisma New SMP will be released in July 12th, 2025.
